We needed to create a program that could easily compare and classify files corresponding to different kinds of driving behavior. In this case, the program scans logs generated while the user was driving on the highway while holding the phone, driving on the highway with phone in pocket, and using the phone at home. The program is able to classify each correctly with ~90% accuracy. This number goes up the more data we have. After building the optimal classifier we integrate it into our app so it can classify behavior in real time!
